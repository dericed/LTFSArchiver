Tape autodetection

LTOType parameter is obsolete and it will not be considered.
LTFSArchiver is now able to detect the correct type of LTO added, during the execution of
the requested action (Format o Check)
To allow LTFSArchiver detect the LTO type an manage at best its free space, three new parameter 
arrays have been added to config file ltfsarchiver.conf

LTO_ALLOWED_CODES=( 0x58 0x99 ) # 0x99 for LTO6 is not actual
LTO_ALLOWED_TYPES=( LTO5 LTO6 )
LTO_WATERMARK=( 20200 30200 )	# 30200 for LTO6 is estimated

The following parameter has been removed:
PPRIMELTO_LTO5LOW

Forced format

Fomat option is now accepting a new value "F"; this option cause a "forced format" of the added tape,
regardless a preexistent LTFS.

Uuid management

An Add call now returns a TEXT message instead of an HTML page 
The uuid assigned to request can be used to monitor the subsequent action (Check orFormat)
using GetStatus and GetResult commands.

Tape device preaassignement 

When a job is dipatched to an external (not library managed) device, LTFSArchiver will
look for a free device before showing the job itself in the "Pending jobs" interface.
The operator wont't need to look for a free device, but the assigned one will be showed.
The operator will simply have to confirm that the requested tape has beel loaded in the
assigned device.
